> “Magma from the mantle intruded the deep crust and cooled slowly. Pyroxene and olivine started to crystallize from the
> magma. Since these where heavier than the surrounding magma, they sank to the bottom of the magma chamber where they
> became layered. Later, the remaining melt intruded higher levels of the continental crust, where it cooled and
> crystallised as tønsbergite, larvikite or lardalite. Some million years later the rock was carved and polished by
> glaciers during the ice age.” [via](https://www.flickr.com/photos/htjems/2708007227/)
