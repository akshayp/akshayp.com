Florence is a great city with a rich historical past. It is populated mainly by tourists from the sights I have seen in the past few days. Everything in the city seems to be related to the Medici family who were the ruling family in Florence during the Renaissance which is when Florence became known as a financial center. Since I'm on tour with some newly made friends and I do a lot of touristy things, I'm going to list stuff I did and what I thought was interesting for all my future posts.
