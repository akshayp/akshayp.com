I was working on redesigning a cafe website and I came up with this great banner idea for something outside the cafe. If
you don't get the banner, it's supposed to say STOP! DETOUR! and go to Queue Cafe to grab a quick bite. It is based on
the cafe's slogan. Check it out below [![Logo](/img/upload/logo1.jpg "Logo")](/img/upload/logo1.jpg)
