I am writing this post as the last one from my road trip through Europe. The one's following this one will hopefully be from a stable internet connection in England ;)

Brugge is a really small town, mostly inhabited by younger people. Our hotel, Ibis was in the very center of the town. It was easy to walk everywhere. Many say that if you want to go to Amsterdam without the marijuana and red light district, then Brugge is where you want to be. I guess i was in the perfect place then. There isn't that much history in the city as such, it just a chill relaxing environment. Here are some of the things I did in Brugge:

*   Eat Samurai Sauce and Fries and chocolate everyday
*   Visit the local cathedral
*   Go to the old town square
*   Go to the Bruges Zot Brewery and see the whole city from the top
*   The local farmers market
*   Take 2 finals :D
*   Leave Belgium for England :(
To say that I was depressed the day we left Brugge would be an understatement. I didn't know what to expect from England. All I know is that I had a great time travelling continental Europe and I really enjoyed the company of old friends, new friends and everyone I came across. If I had to do it again I'd prefer it was the same people I did it with. I'm really glad I made this trip as I made memories during this trip that I will cherish all my life. That's it for now. We are off to England now via the chunnel . That is one thing I am definitely excited about. A bus that gets on to a train under the ocean for transportation. Wohoo. England here I come!
