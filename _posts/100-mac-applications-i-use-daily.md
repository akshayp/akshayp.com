[![app_store](/img/upload/app_store.jpg "app_store")](/img/upload/app_store.jpg)I have seen way too many of these 100
applications to use lists. I figured i make my own, something that is less commercial and more from experience of
breaking my computer a dozen times. Some of these might be different compared to public opinion but give them a shot and
you might just see yourself starting to like them. A lot of these are biased from the perspective of web development
because thats what I do. Anyway,here goes:

<!--more-->

#### Browsers:

[Firefox 3.5](https://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html) with the following plugins:

* [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/en/)
* [ColorZilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/271) to find colors values within Firefox

  designer. I also have plugins for Firebug like [FirePHP](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6149),

[iTunes ](https://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/?ref=https://itunes.com)is hands down the best music client for MacOS or

after close to 5 yrs of development! [DivX Player ](https://www.divx.com/en/mac)for those random sites that complain
