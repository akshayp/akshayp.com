> I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me&#8230; but it&#8217;s hard to stay mad, when there&#8217;s so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I&#8217;m seeing it all at once, and it&#8217;s too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that&#8217;s about to burst&#8230; And then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain and I can&#8217;t feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life&#8230; You have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about, I&#8217;m sure. But don&#8217;t worry&#8230; you will someday.
