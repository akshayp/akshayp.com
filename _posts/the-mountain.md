> This was filmed between 4th and 11th April 2011. I had the pleasure of visiting El Teide. Spain´s highest mountain
> @(3718m) is one of the best places in the world to photograph the stars and is also the location of Teide
> Observatories, considered to be one of the world´s best observatories. The goal was to capture the beautiful Milky Way
> galaxy along with one of the most amazing mountains I know El Teide. I have to say this was one of the most exhausting
> trips I have done. There was a lot of hiking at high altitudes and probably less than 10 hours of sleep in total for
> the whole week. Having been here 10-11 times before I had a long list of must-see locations I wanted to capture for
> this movie, but I am still not 100% used to carrying around so much gear required for time-lapse movies.
