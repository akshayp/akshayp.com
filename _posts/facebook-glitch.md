So I was commenting on some photos on facebook, and somehow the timestamps made the comment display as if it was in the future. You can see that in the photo below.

Apparently it can predict my future. I wonder what actually caused this to happen. Notice the time is 2.59 am. It is right about to change to 12.00 am pacific time. Maybe that server time caused the error in the timestamp. One can only wonder eh?
