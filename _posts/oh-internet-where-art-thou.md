You don't realize how much you need something until you actually dont have it. For me it's the internet. I sound like a
crack addict, so be it. I didn't realize how often and how much I have taken this web of information for granted. Here
in Italy Internet is scarce. I have no free wi-fi anywhere. Small town Sienna on top of a hill in the middle of nowhere
had free internet for 30 mins. Thats it. Other than that the Best western has given us about 2 hrs a day for internet
which I am currently using in the room. Hopefully it lasts us through our stay in Rome

But yea doesn't seem like I am going to get to update this too often . I will try to update it whenever and wherever I
can . So keep checking and look at the pictures. Italy is a very beautiful country

Ciao.
