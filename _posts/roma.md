Rome, is a massive dump. If it wasn't for its rich history it would well be classified as a third world city. There is trash everywhere. There are tourists everywhere and the place is swarming with people at any given time of the day. Enough complaining for now. Nevertheless, the public transport in Rome is one of the most well laid out systems you could use as a tourist to get across the city. The city is rich in history and is listed as a World Heritage Site. It is also a reminder of the greatness of Renaissance and Baroque culture. I spent a long time in Rome at the Best Western. There is something comforting about staying in brand name hotels, it gives a sense of consistency and quality. Saurabh joined us in Rome and spent 2 days with us at the hotel. The fact that it is a major city in Italy makes it easier to bargain hunt. Food and drink are definitely cheaper here. It's a fun city to be in if can ignore the garbage. It's easy for me since I'm from India :)
