> In our culture weâ€™ve been trained for individual differences to stand out so you look at each person and the immediate thought is brighter, dumber, richer older, younger, poorer and we make all these dimensional distinctions and put them into categories and treat them that way. We get so that we only see others as separate from ourselves as just separate. One of the dramatic characteristics of experience is being with another person and suddenly seeing the ways in which they are like you and not different from you and experiencing the fact that which is essence in you and which is essence in me is indeed one and that there is no other. It is all one. <cite> Zeitgeist </cite>
